## Installation

1. Place files in home.cs.siue.edu server using a SFTP and FTP client (Windows users specificaly require a client like WinSCP). 

2. The directory should contain the project1.cpp file along with all the text files from P1AASeqs.zip and P1SubMatrices.zip . 

3. Look at Proper_Folder_Structure.png for guidence.

## Usage

1. Navigate to folder containing Project_1.cpp on home.cs.siue.edu server.

2. Use this command to genereate a.out file ``` g++ project1.cpp```.

3. Run the a.out file with this command ```./a.out```, the program should begin running after this command.

4. Follow the instructions on screen for further guidence.

5. I recommend running the terminal maxamize since the output can get messed up since I'm using tab's to keep it relatively easy to read.
